    <p>
      DebateWithData is an
      <a href="https://github.com/maxbogue/debatewithdata">open source</a>
      project started by Max Bogue to improve the quality of discussions
      (especially political ones). It was inspired by frustrations with the 2016
      presidential election season and the growing political divide in the
      United States and around the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thesis behind DebateWithData is that by having discussions
      asynchronously and connecting claims to the data that backs them, the
      quality of discussions people can have in person can be improved. It's
      impossible to properly research a topic from scratch while in the middle
      of a verbal discussion, but perhaps finding the research others have done
      on this site can help.

      If the project gains traction, the intent is to create a non-profit to
      manage it. The code is licensed under the
