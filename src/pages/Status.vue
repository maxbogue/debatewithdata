  <p>DebateWithData is still in an early alpha stage.</p>

    <h2>Alpha Users</h2>
    <p>The biggest contribution anyone can make right now is adding content to
    the site and giving feedback. DWD simply needs more content to see whether
    it can be a useful tool for the world.</p>

    <h2>Recent Changes</h2>

      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2018-03-16:</strong> Control/info bar is now always shown and
        tapping a point now navigates to the linked source/claim.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2018-03-15:</strong> Points are now always links to claims or

    <h2>Coming Improvements</h2>

    <h3>Notifications</h3>
    <p>
      There needs to be some sort of notification system for when people edit
      or comment on things that you've starred or edited yourself.
    </p>

    <h3>Search</h3>
    <p>
      It&#39;s difficult to find things right now. There will be a search
      feature to find topics, claims, and sources by text.
    </p>

    <h3>Raw Data</h3>
    <p>
      Since data is core to the mission of this project, there needs to be a way
      to display source data directly as a graph. Possibly this should also
      include a way to perform analysis of the data within the project.
    </p>

    <h3>User Data</h3>
    <p>
      What has been done by a specific user (including yourself) is currently
      not shown anywhere. There will be:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A public user page showing contribution activity.</li>
      <li>
        A private section on your account page showing starred items for easy
        access.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
